King Naresuan is acknowledged in Thai history as a revered monarch, celebrated for successfully leading campaigns to liberate the Ayutthaya Kingdom from the suzerainty of the Taungoo Empire, asserting Ayutthaya's independence through numerous conflicts with Taungoo Burma, and establishing diplomatic or trade relations by welcoming the Dutch.

However, historical discourse presents a notable controversy concerning the accuracy of the celebrated elephant duel between King Naresuan and Mingyi Swa. While this event is a cornerstone of prevailing Thai historical narratives, early Siamese records and European accounts do not corroborate a formal elephant duel. Furthermore, Burmese chronicles offer an alternative account, stating that Mingyi Swa's death resulted from a Siamese mortar round, thereby casting doubt on a significant event attributed to King Naresuan in traditional Thai history.

This comparison highlights a discrepancy between nationally celebrated historical accounts and alternative historical records regarding a key event in King Naresuan's life, illustrating the complexities inherent in historical interpretation.
